## Pokémon Guessing Game
"Pokémon Guessing Game" is an engaging app that is designed for both fans and newcomers to the Pokémon franchise. The game is presented in a hangman-style format, where the user has six turns to guess the name of the Pokémon. Users are able to enter a single letter each turn, or guess the Pokémon name outright by entering a full name guess. The Pokémon's silhouette and type are given as hints. When the game is over, the Pokémon is revealed. Key features include guessing history, user statistics, customizable icons, and game rules. <br/>
